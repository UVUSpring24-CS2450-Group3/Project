## Code Inspection Checklist

1. **Code Formatting and Style:**
   - **Consistent Formatting:** The code appears to be consistently formatted.
   - **Naming Conventions:** Variable and function names follow standard Python conventions, adhering to lowercase with underscores for readability.

2. **Correctness and Completeness:**
   - **Algorithm Implementation:** The algorithms seem correctly implemented based on the provided specifications.
   - **Logical Errors:** No obvious logical errors or incorrect assumptions are apparent, although a more thorough testing might be needed.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - **Unnecessary Computations:** There doesn't appear to be any significant unnecessary computations or redundant operations.
   - **Optimization:** While the code seems straightforward, optimization could be considered based on specific performance requirements, but nothing glaringly inefficient stands out.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - **Exception Handling:** Potential errors or exceptions seem to be handled appropriately, with exceptions raised and caught where necessary.
   - **Input Validation:** Some input validation is present, such as verifying the length of the program data before loading it into memory, which helps prevent unexpected issues.

5. **Documentation and Comments:**
   - **Code Documentation:** The code could benefit from additional inline comments to explain complex logic or clarify the purpose of certain sections.
   - **Function Documentation:** Each function is accompanied by a docstring, which is good practice for explaining their behavior.

6. **Security:**
   - **Security Vulnerabilities:** The code appears to be free from obvious security vulnerabilities like SQL injections or buffer overflows.
   - **Data Encryption:** Since this code doesn't handle sensitive data or interact with external systems, data encryption isn't a concern here.

7. **Portability and Maintainability:**
   - **Code Adaptability:** The code is structured in a way that allows for easy adaptation or modification, with functions separated into logical components.
   - **Hard-coded Values:** There don't seem to be any hard-coded values that could be problematic for maintainability; however, introducing constants for magic numbers might improve clarity and maintainability in the long term.

Overall, the code appears well-written and functional, with room for minor improvements in documentation and potentially optimization based on specific requirements.
