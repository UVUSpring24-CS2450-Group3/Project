1. **test_add**: This test case verifies the functionality of addition operation in UVSim. It simulates input of two numbers (8 and 9), loads a program into the UVSim instance, executes the program step by step, and asserts that the accumulator register (`acc`) holds the correct sum (17) after the execution.

2. **test_sub**: This test case validates the subtraction operation in UVSim. It involves two scenarios:
   - The first scenario simulates input of two numbers (2003 and -208), loads a program into UVSim, executes it, and verifies that the accumulator register holds the correct result (2211) after execution.
   - The second scenario resets the UVSim instance and repeats the process with different input values (9999 and 8381), verifying that the accumulator register holds the correct result (1618) after execution.

These test cases cover addition and subtraction operations in UVSim, ensuring their correctness under different input scenarios. Additional test cases can be implemented to cover other functionalities such as multiplication, division, branching, error handling, and program loading. Each test case should simulate different input scenarios and verify the expected behavior of the UVSim instance after executing the program.
