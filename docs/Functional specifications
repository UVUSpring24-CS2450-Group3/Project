Program Loading: The system should be able to load a program into memory, ensuring that the size of the program does not exceed the available memory space.
Memory Management: The memory should be capable of storing and retrieving data based on memory addresses.
Instruction Execution: The system should execute instructions according to the opcode and operand stored in memory, updating the program counter accordingly.
Input Handling: It should handle input operations, waiting for input from the user if necessary and storing it in memory for processing.
Output Handling: The system should handle output operations, sending output data to the appropriate output destination.
Arithmetic Operations: Arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division should be executed correctly, updating the accumulator register accordingly.
Branching: Conditional and unconditional branching should be supported, allowing the program to jump to different sections of code based on specified conditions.
Error Handling: The system should provide appropriate error messages if an undefined opcode is encountered or if any other errors occur during execution.
Debugging Mode: Debugging mode should be available, allowing for more detailed output during program execution for debugging purposes.
Halt Functionality: The system should be able to halt execution upon encountering a halt instruction, terminating the program gracefully.
